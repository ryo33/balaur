//! Audio as a Balaur plugin, backed by rodio.
//!
//! `audio.play` hands back an integer handle; `stop`, `set_volume`,
//! `set_pitch` and `is_playing` address it. The `sound` component gives a
//! node a configured sound, triggered by `audio.play_on` / `audio.stop_on`.
//! A sound with a place in the world — a `positional` component, or a `play`
//! given a `position` — is heard from the `listener` node: see [`spatial`].
//!
//! Audio is a pure observer of the simulation. If no output device is
//! available (CI, headless servers) the plugin logs a warning once, every
//! call still hands out the same handles, and `is_playing` answers false —
//! a game runs identically with and without a sound card. Anything that
//! feeds a decision (the `sound` component's "already started" check) is
//! therefore tracked as intent on [`Sound`], never read off a sink.
//!
//! Wasm builds are the extreme case of that rule: no audio stack compiles
//! there at all (see the backend modules below), so the whole backend is the
//! "no device" path and scripts calling `audio.*` still run.
