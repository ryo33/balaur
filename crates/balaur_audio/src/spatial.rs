//! Positional audio: where the ears are, where a sound is, and what the
//! distance between them does to it.
//!
//! A `listener` node is the ears; a `sound` marked `positional`, or an
//! `audio.play` given a `position`, is an emitter. Once a frame's transforms
//! have settled, every live emitter is re-placed: distance sets its gain, its
//! offset across the listener's right sets its pan, and the speed the two
//! close at bends its pitch. All of it multiplies the bus chain rather than
//! replacing it, so a positional sound still answers the `sfx` slider.
//!
//! Nothing here reaches the simulation. It runs after the tick, off poses the
//! frame already decided, and writes to sinks and to the [`Placement`] each
//! handle remembers — which is what a run with no output device can still
//! assert, the same rule the rest of this crate holds to.
