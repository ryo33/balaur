//! Audio buses: a tree of gains a sound plays through.
//!
//! ```toml
//! [audio.buses]
//! sfx = { volume = 0.9 }
//! music = { volume = 0.6 }
//! ui = { volume = 1.0, parent = "sfx" }
//! ```
//!
//! A sound's gain is its own volume times every bus's up to the root, so a
//! player pulling the music slider moves every piece of music at once and
//! nothing else. `master` exists whether or not the project declares it,
//! because there has to be a name for "everything".
//!
//! This is the mixing a game asks for. It is not a mixing *graph* — no
//! effects, no sends — and a bus does not own a sound: routing is a property
//! of the playback, which is what lets one file be a footstep on `sfx` and a
//! menu click on `ui`.
