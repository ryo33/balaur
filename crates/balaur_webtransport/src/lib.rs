//! WebTransport over QUIC, behind [`Transport`].
//!
//! What the websocket transport pretends to be, this one is. A datagram here
//! is a real unreliable datagram: losing one costs a misprediction the
//! rollback session already knows how to repair, where over TCP it stalls
//! every input behind it until the retransmit lands. The reliable channel is
//! one bidirectional stream, for the handshake and the digests.
//!
//! **Async underneath, polled on top.** `web-transport-quinn` is written for
//! tokio and the engine is not: nothing may block or await on the frame loop.
//! So a link owns a worker thread running a current-thread runtime, and talks
//! to the engine over the same two channels the websocket worker uses —
//! commands out, events in. The runtime never leaves that thread.
//!
//! **QUIC is always TLS**, with no plaintext mode to fall back to. A server
//! generates a self-signed certificate by default, so two engines on one
//! machine need no setup, and the client accepts it by hash. Anything shipped
//! passes a real certificate and key instead. A browser will accept a
//! self-signed certificate by hash too, but only while it is valid for at
//! most two weeks.
