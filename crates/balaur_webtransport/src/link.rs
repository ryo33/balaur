//! The worker thread: a current-thread tokio runtime bridging the async QUIC
//! session to the engine's two channels.
//!
//! One thread per link, one runtime per thread, and the runtime never leaves
//! it. The engine side sees only `Sender<LinkCommand>` and
//! `Receiver<LinkEvent>`, exactly as it does for a websocket.
//!
//! The reliable channel is one bidirectional stream, and a stream is bytes
//! rather than messages, so every reliable payload goes out behind a four
//! byte big-endian length. Datagrams need no framing: QUIC already delivers
//! them whole or not at all, which is the entire point of using them.
