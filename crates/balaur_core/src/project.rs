//! Project manifest and declarative scene files.
//!
//! A project is a directory (Godot-style):
//!
//! ```text
//! project.eure           # name + main scene
//! scenes/main.eure        # node tree
//! scripts/*.rn            # node scripts
//! ```
//!
//! Scene files declare the node tree; behavior lives in scripts. Keys the
//! core does not know are dispatched to plugin-registered handlers, so a
//! plugin can teach scenes new keys (e.g. `shape = "ball"`).
