//! Shared game content: what Godot calls a Resource.
//!
//! An asset is data several nodes want to *share* and that is too big to
//! inline in a scene node — an animation clip, later a prefab or a material.
//! `Engine::resource` is already the engine's typemap of singletons, so
//! content takes the other word (`docs/NAMING.md` D1).
//!
//! **One rule: a string is a reference, a table is a definition.** Every
//! asset-typed component property accepts either, and
//! `crate::components` applies that rule once for every asset type that will
//! ever be registered.
//!
//! Three reference forms an author writes, and no more:
//!
//! | Form | Means |
//! |---|---|
//! | `"animations/hero.eure"` | the whole file |
//! | `"animations/hero.eure#run"` | the entry named `run` inside it |
//! | `"#hero_idle"` | an `[[assets]]` block in the same scene file |
//!
//! A fourth, `"#!<hex>"`, is written by nobody: it is what an inline
//! definition is *rewritten to* once the cache has recorded it, and it takes
//! a `#entry` suffix for the same reason a file does — an inline table is as
//! free to be a library of named assets as a file is.
//!
//! Core never learns what an asset *is*: a plugin registers a parser with
//! `App::register_asset_type`, the parser returns an opaque `Rc<dyn Any>`, and
//! the plugin downcasts it — exactly as the typemap does. Sharing is the
//! default (two nodes naming one path get one parsed object); [`duplicate`]
//! opts out with a private copy.
