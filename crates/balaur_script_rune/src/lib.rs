//! The Rune script host: loading, instancing, hot reload, precompiled packs.
//!
//! Scripting model: a `.rn` file declares free functions taking the instance
//! as their first argument. One instance object is created per node the
//! script is attached to, and the host hands it back on every call.
//!
//! ```rune
//! pub fn init(this) { this.angle = 0.0; }
//! pub fn update(this, dt) { this.angle += dt; }
//! ```
//!
//! A Rune object handed into a function is mutated in place, so what a script
//! writes to `this` is what the host sees on the next frame.
